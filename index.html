  <h1>Haleemah's CS 499 Capstone Portfolio</h1>

  <section id="self-assessment">
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>As I reach the end of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am happy to reflect on all the knowledge, abilities, and experience I have obtained over the course of this program. Building this portfolio has allowed me to demonstrate not only my technical skills, but also my development as a problem solver, collaborator, and upcoming professional. This journey has truly helped me in finding what I want in my career goals and prepared me to make significant contributions in a variety of areas within the tech sector.</p>
    <p>The ePortfolio demonstrates the breadth and diversity of my skill set through the modifications I've made to my mobile inventory management application. Each enhancement I've made represents a different aspect of computer science, ranging from architectural improvements to expanding features and cloud integration. Working on this project pushed me to think critically, use what I've learned throughout my courses, and tackle real world challenges with practical solutions. I also found that it drove me to think about long term maintainability, user experience, and security at all stages of development.</p>
    <p>Aside from this capstone project, the curriculum as a whole helped me build critical skills that I know are going to help me when I join the workforce. For example:</p>
    <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Collaboration was an important aspect of my experience throughout my entire program. I frequently used discussion boards and peer interactions to solve problems, share ideas, and provide valuable feedback with my classmates. These discussions frequently simplified complicated topics and allowed me to approach challenges from new angles. Moreover, communicating technical concepts in writing also helped me improve my ability to explain code logic and my system design choices in a straightforward manner. This regular interaction helped me establish a collaborative mentality that promotes working together, technological development, and mutual success.</p>
    <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>Being technically proficient is vital, but so is the ability to communicate those talents to others. Many of my courses highlighted the value of clear and professional communication. For example, throughout my program, I created user documentation, did code reviews, and drafted design proposals for technical as well as non-technical audiences. From all of this, I learned how to adapt my message based on my audience, whether I was discussing a data structure with a colleague or justifying a design/development plan to an instructor. Now, being able to communicate effectively, especially with stakeholders, is a skill that I bring to each project I work on.</p>
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Understanding and using algorithms and data structures has been a critical component of my learning. Throughout this program, I have learned to use arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. I also learned how to use Big O notation to analyze algorithm efficiency and techniques such as recursion, dynamic programming, and sorting. I applied this knowledge I gained in a variety of my courses, including in my capstone, where I utilized filtering and sorting logic to efficiently handle inventory data on a mobile platform.</p>
    <h3>Software Engineering and Database Knowledge</h3>
    <p>Through my coursework, I obtained expertise in developing maintainable, modular software based on object oriented principles. I experimented with building apps utilizing patterns like Model View Controller and discovered the value of the separation of roles. I also learned about relational databases and cloud storage, including how to use SQLite for local data and Firebase for cloud integration. These abilities assisted me in handling data persistence and synchronization in my capstone project, as well as providing a solid base in full-stack development.</p>
    <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
    <p>Security was a recurring subject throughout my entire program from beginning to end, and it is an area that I have learned to value very much. I have previously done research on cybersecurity principles, discovered what common errors/vulnerabilities are, and explored how to develop more secure systems. I now view development from a security-first approach. For example, in my capstone project, I used Firebase Authentication to protect user data, handled secure login and access control, and made sure to validate input and handle data safely. I recognize that good software is not only effective but also safe for its users, and I intend to take this approach with me into all of my future initiatives.</p>
    <h3>Capstone Enhancements</h3>
    <p>Although all of my enhancements are on the same artifact, they reflect a diverse set of skills and knowledge. For instance, my initial enhancement improved the application's structure by applying the Model View Controller architecture, making the codebase more structured and simpler to maintain. Furthermore, my second enhancement provided filtering/sorting functionality to help users detect low-stock and expired products, which required me to employ algorithms and user-centered design thinking. Lastly, my third enhancement entailed integrating Firebase for cloud storage and user authentication, demonstrating my ability to deal with modern cloud technologies while prioritizing secure data management.</p>
    <p>These changes illustrate my ability to create, modify, and deploy professional level applications. They also show my willingness to face challenges in practical software development, from the original concept to testing, deployment, and updates post deployment.</p>
    <p>This ePortfolio reflects more than simply the achievement of my degree. It covers the history of how I've progressed as a computer science student, how I've used what I've learned, and how I'm now ready to apply these abilities in the next stage of my career. I’m very proud of the work I’ve done and excited for the opportunities ahead. Whether I'm working with a team, communicating with stakeholders, developing secure code, or designing efficient algorithms, I'm ready to add value and keep learning as I advance in the profession.</p>
