  <h1>Haleemah's CS 499 Capstone Portfolio</h1>

  <section id="self-assessment">
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>As I reach the end of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am happy to reflect on all the knowledge, abilities, and experience I have obtained over the course of this program. Building this portfolio has allowed me to demonstrate not only my technical skills, but also my development as a problem solver, collaborator, and upcoming professional. This journey has truly helped me in finding what I want in my career goals and prepared me to make significant contributions in a variety of areas within the tech sector.</p>
    <p>The ePortfolio demonstrates the breadth and diversity of my skill set through the modifications I've made to my mobile inventory management application. Each enhancement I've made represents a different aspect of computer science, ranging from architectural improvements to expanding features and cloud integration. Working on this project pushed me to think critically, use what I've learned throughout my courses, and tackle real world challenges with practical solutions. I also found that it drove me to think about long term maintainability, user experience, and security at all stages of development.</p>
    <p>Aside from this capstone project, the curriculum as a whole helped me build critical skills that I know are going to help me when I join the workforce. For example:</p>
    <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Collaboration was an important aspect of my experience throughout my entire program. I frequently used discussion boards and peer interactions to solve problems, share ideas, and provide valuable feedback with my classmates. These discussions frequently simplified complicated topics and allowed me to approach challenges from new angles. Moreover, communicating technical concepts in writing also helped me improve my ability to explain code logic and my system design choices in a straightforward manner. This regular interaction helped me establish a collaborative mentality that promotes working together, technological development, and mutual success.</p>
    <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>Being technically proficient is vital, but so is the ability to communicate those talents to others. Many of my courses highlighted the value of clear and professional communication. For example, throughout my program, I created user documentation, did code reviews, and drafted design proposals for technical as well as non-technical audiences. From all of this, I learned how to adapt my message based on my audience, whether I was discussing a data structure with a colleague or justifying a design/development plan to an instructor. Now, being able to communicate effectively, especially with stakeholders, is a skill that I bring to each project I work on.</p>
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Understanding and using algorithms and data structures has been a critical component of my learning. Throughout this program, I have learned to use arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. I also learned how to use Big O notation to analyze algorithm efficiency and techniques such as recursion, dynamic programming, and sorting. I applied this knowledge I gained in a variety of my courses, including in my capstone, where I utilized filtering and sorting logic to efficiently handle inventory data on a mobile platform.</p>
    <h3>Software Engineering and Database Knowledge</h3>
    <p>Through my coursework, I obtained expertise in developing maintainable, modular software based on object oriented principles. I experimented with building apps utilizing patterns like Model View Controller and discovered the value of the separation of roles. I also learned about relational databases and cloud storage, including how to use SQLite for local data and Firebase for cloud integration. These abilities assisted me in handling data persistence and synchronization in my capstone project, as well as providing a solid base in full-stack development.</p>
    <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
    <p>Security was a recurring subject throughout my entire program from beginning to end, and it is an area that I have learned to value very much. I have previously done research on cybersecurity principles, discovered what common errors/vulnerabilities are, and explored how to develop more secure systems. I now view development from a security-first approach. For example, in my capstone project, I used Firebase Authentication to protect user data, handled secure login and access control, and made sure to validate input and handle data safely. I recognize that good software is not only effective but also safe for its users, and I intend to take this approach with me into all of my future initiatives.</p>
    <h3>Capstone Enhancements</h3>
    <p>Although all of my enhancements are on the same artifact, they reflect a diverse set of skills and knowledge. For instance, my initial enhancement improved the application's structure by applying the Model View Controller architecture, making the codebase more structured and simpler to maintain. Furthermore, my second enhancement provided filtering/sorting functionality to help users detect low-stock and expired products, which required me to employ algorithms and user-centered design thinking. Lastly, my third enhancement entailed integrating Firebase for cloud storage and user authentication, demonstrating my ability to deal with modern cloud technologies while prioritizing secure data management.</p>
    <p>These changes illustrate my ability to create, modify, and deploy professional level applications. They also show my willingness to face challenges in practical software development, from the original concept to testing, deployment, and updates post deployment.</p>
    <p>This ePortfolio reflects more than simply the achievement of my degree. It covers the history of how I've progressed as a computer science student, how I've used what I've learned, and how I'm now ready to apply these abilities in the next stage of my career. I’m very proud of the work I’ve done and excited for the opportunities ahead. Whether I'm working with a team, communicating with stakeholders, developing secure code, or designing efficient algorithms, I'm ready to add value and keep learning as I advance in the profession.</p>

  <section id="enhancement1">
    <h2>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>

    <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
    <p>The artifact I chose for enhancement is a mobile inventory management application I created during my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course last term. The application lets users log in, view, and manage inventory items, and conduct typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activities on a local SQLite database. The initial version of the program was functional, but it lacked architectural structure and had overlapping between user interface code, logic, and data handling.</p>
    
    <h3>Reason for Selection & Improvements</h3>
    <p>I chose this item for enhancement because it allowed me to demonstrate a stronger grasp of software engineering design concepts, specifically the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The app was more difficult to maintain, expand, and test in the previous codebase since a large portion of the logic, such as managing user actions and data manipulation, was tightly interconnected with the UI Activities.</p>
    <p>To fix this, I changed the project's structure to follow the MVC pattern, where the program is now divided into three separate layers (model, view, and controller).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model:</strong> This handles the data logic and SQLite database operations.</li>
      <li><strong>View:</strong> This consists of the XML layout files (which remain in the res/layout directory as required by Android) and activity classes responsible for displaying data and handling user input.</li>
      <li><strong>Controller:</strong> This is a layer with a new specialized InventoryController class that handles business logic and serves as a link between the model and the view layers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This restructure encourages separation of responsibilities, enhances code modularity, and promotes scalability and maintainability. I also restructured the current Kotlin files into appropriate packages (controller, view, and model) to match the architectural change and make the codebase simpler and more understandable to navigate.</p>

    <h3>Course Outcomes Alignment</h3>
    <p>This enhancement aligns with the following course outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By rebuilding this artifact with the MVC pattern, I proved my ability to use core computer science design concepts to improve an existing application. I made deliberate design trade-offs to strike a compromise between short-term goals like retaining functionality with SQLite and long-term scalability like building a structure suited for Firebase (a future enhancement). I also demonstrated my ability to design practical solutions with clean, testable, and maintainable code structures by utilizing modern development tools and techniques.</p>

    <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
    <p>The process of improving the application was both tough and very worthwhile. I began by noting the flaws in the previous structure, specifically how roles were not clearly split. The activity classes were doing too much by handling both the UI and the application logic, making the app difficult to comprehend and practically impossible to unit test.</p>
    <p>To address this, I added a new InventoryController class that handles interactions between the user interface and the data model. I also refactored existing functionality to comply with MVC standards, which included rewriting various sections of code to make sure that each layer was well defined and connected with others in a clean/organized manner. I also modified the view layer to delegate logical operations to the controller, and I packed the SQLite operations in the model layer.</p>
    <p>One of the most difficult aspects of this development for me was rearranging the codebase while avoiding bugs. Since Android apps are tightly coupled between UI and functionality, getting rid of this dependency to make sure I had a clean design required a lot of meticulous planning. I needed to make sure that each layer communicated effectively (especially between the controller and the model) without breaking encapsulation.</p>
    <p>My understanding of architectural design patterns in mobile development has grown as a result of this enhancement. I discovered that even a small project could benefit tremendously from following MVC principles. It also reaffirmed how important modular code is for maintainability and for making future improvements, like integrating Firebase later on, much simpler. Overall, by utilizing industry standard best practices, I definitely obtained practical skills in refactoring code, restructuring Kotlin files based on their purposes, and enhancing a mobile application's overall structure.</p>

    <h2>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>

    <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
    <p>The artifact is an Android inventory management application I developed initially during my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course last term. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete inventory items stored locally in an SQLite database. The program accurately recorded basic item details such as name, amount, and category, but it did not enable regulating item expiry dates, which is an important function for inventory control in many real-world scenarios. This addition, implemented in this enhancement, included expiry date tracking features to help with inventory monitoring and management.</p>

    <h3>Reason for Selection & Improvements</h3>
    <p>I chose this item for my ePortfolio because it clearly illustrates my ability to enhance an existing program by incorporating new data structures and introducing algorithmic logic to improve its functionality and usability. To enhance the artifact, I started by modifying the data model in Item.kt to include a new property called expirationDate, which is represented as a string in "yyyy-mm-dd" format. This necessitated changes to the SQLite database schema in DatabaseHelper.kt, where I added an expiration_date field to the inventory_items table and increased the database version to accommodate schema upgrades. I also reviewed all important CRUD operations (insertInventoryItem, getAllInventoryItems, and updateInventoryItem) to ensure that expiry data is correctly saved, retrieved, and synced with the database.</p>
    <p>Beyond the data layer, I improved the user experience by altering many XML layout files. I added an EditText to dialog_add_item.xml and dialog_item_details.xml so that users could reliably insert or alter expiration dates. I also added a new TextView to inventory_item_row.xml to display each item's expiration date in the inventory list for an easy visual reference. Moreover, I changed the main inventory layout/dashboard, activity_inventory.xml, to include an expiration column heading, ensuring clear alignment and readability.</p>
    <p>For better usability, I also added dynamic filtering and sorting algorithms to InventoryAdapter.kt, allowing users to organize inventory items in real time based on stock status and expiry dates. I added a filter spinner and a sort button to a new control bar in activity_inventory.xml and connected them in InventoryActivity.kt with listeners that interact with the adapter's logic. This connection enables the app to respond to user selections in real time, enhancing navigation and inventory management.</p>
    <p>These enhancements demonstrate my ability to manage changing data structures, apply algorithmic concepts to data manipulation, and synchronize data flow across the database, adapter, and user interface. I believe the artifact was significantly improved by introducing expiration tracking, increasing data visibility, and enabling responsive, user-driven sorting and filtering capabilities that will facilitate advanced inventory management functions in the future like emphasizing low stock items or making alerts for products that are about to expire.</p>

    <h3>Course Outcomes Alignment</h3>
    <p>This enhancement aligns with the following course outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By including expiry date tracking and dynamic filtering and sorting algorithms, I exhibited my ability to create and assess practical computing solutions that meet real world customer needs. I carefully analyzed the trade-offs between expanding the data model and database design and preserving app performance and usability. Furthermore, the algorithms I created allow users to efficiently arrange and prioritize inventory items, demonstrating my ability to apply algorithmic concepts to data management and user interaction. This enhancement proves that I met my outcome of developing a more functioning and responsive application using strong computer science techniques.</p>

    <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, I learned a lot about the difficulties associated with growing an existing application’s data model and functionality. One of the most essential things I learned was the need for proper planning to carry out database schema modifications. For example, updating the database version and creating the onUpgrade method to incorporate the new expiration date column without losing existing data proved to be pretty tricky. It needed me to learn how SQLite handles migrations and do thorough testing to minimize crashes/data corruption.</p>
    <p>Additionally, working on the InventoryAdapter's filtering and sorting functions offered me experience with algorithms that effectively handle and update data shown in real time. I learnt how to connect UI components like spinners and buttons to adapter logic, so that changes in user input are promptly reflected in the inventory list. This approach helped me learn event-driven programming and how to make sure the UI state is linked with the underlying data on Android.</p>
    <p>Another challenge was to completely incorporate the expiration date field into all CRUD processes. I had to carefully modify every method that inserts, retrieves, or changes inventory items to add this new information.</p>
    <p>Overall, this enhancement helped me improve my abilities in data modeling, filtering and sorting algorithms, UI integration with data logic, and database upgrade management. It also underlined to me the need for modular, well-organized code in facilitating future changes. I'm now more equipped to manage more complex software features in the future thanks to this experience.</p>

    <h2>Enhancement 3: Databases</h2>

    <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
    <p>The artifact is an Android inventory management application I developed initially during my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course last term. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete inventory items stored locally in an SQLite database. In this enhancement, I replaced the local database with Firebase for user authentication and real-time cloud inventory management. This change enables a more scalable and modern application architecture.</p>

    <h3>Reason for Selection & Improvements</h3>
    <p>I chose this item for my ePortfolio because it illustrates my abilities to improve an application I already created using cloud based tools. Firebase integration is a significant update which required me to become familiar with asynchronous operations, real time data syncing, and user authentication (these are all essential skill sets in today's mobile development scene which is why I thought it was perfect to showcase in my ePortfolio).</p>
    <p>This enhancement required that I changed many files in the application, specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>build.gradle (both at the app and project level):</strong> I added the necessary Firebase dependencies, including firebase-auth and firebase-database, and set up the google-services plugin to make sure Firebase was properly initialized. These adjustments were necessary to provide cloud support in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>FirebaseUtil.kt (new file I created):</strong> I designed a centralized utility class that handles all Firebase activities. This contains user registration, login, and CRUD actions on inventory items. I also made sure that each item stored in Firebase has its own unique ID, which can then be used to quickly track and update data.</li>
      <li><strong>Item.kt:</strong> I added an id field to the data model with a default value of null. I additionally provided default values for other properties that facilitate Firebase's object mapping and deserialization. These modifications were required to be able to access and modify inventory data stored in Firebase.</li>
      <li><strong>InventoryActivity.kt:</strong> Here I replaced all SQLite references with calls to the Firebase utility. This included changing the way data was retrieved, displayed, and updated in the app. I also handled asynchronous Firebase data retrieval with callbacks.</li>
      <li><strong>InventoryAdapter.kt:</strong> I changed the adapter to use Firebase's id attribute for delete and update operations. This update guaranteed that the right inventory item was changed in the cloud database and that the UI reflects these real time changes.</li>
      <li><strong>LoginActivity.kt:</strong> I changed the login logic to utilize Firebase authentication. This not only allowed users to register and log in using their email addresses and passwords, but it also increased security and scalability. The login screen now uses FirebaseAuth to authenticate users before providing access to the inventory dashboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These modifications demonstrate my abilities to provide secure authentication, handle cloud-based data, and redesign an application for more scale and easy maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Course Outcomes Alignment</h3>
    <p>This enhancement aligns with the following course outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By integrating Firebase, I was able to tackle common software concerns including safe user authentication and real time data storage. I believe this enhancement added significant value to the application by allowing for multi-device access, user-specific data management, and a more flexible architecture. Using Firebase also illustrates my proficiency with modern frameworks and industry technologies, as it reflects the type of cloud-based solutions frequently used in corporate mobile apps.</p>

    <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
    <p>When I reflect on the process of enhancing this artifact, I find that improving this artifact made me think beyond local solutions and adopt real time, cloud-based data management. One of the most difficult issues I faced was dealing with asynchronous data operations in Kotlin. In loadInventoryFromFirebase(), I defined a callback interface to retrieve inventory items from Firebase and update the RecyclerView after the data was retrieved. This forced me to think reactively where I was waiting for Firebase responses before altering the UI. It definitely helped me better grasp asynchronous programming and how to keep the user interface in sync with real time data changes, but it was challenging at first.</p>
    <p>Another problem I faced was refactoring the code to replace SQLite while preserving the user experience. This needed me to have an intricate understanding of how data flows through the app. It also needed me to accurately coordinate between the user interface, data models, and backend functionality. I also had to guarantee that the app could smoothly handle permission checks, login issues, and data sync failures. All of this proved to be challenging, but it taught me a lot as well.</p>
    <p>This technique helped me get a better understanding of creating scalable mobile apps that meet real world needs like secure login, fast updates, and ongoing data storage. I now have greater faith in my abilities to design and develop reliable Android apps that function well in real life settings while using modern tools.</p>
